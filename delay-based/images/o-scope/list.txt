------------------------------------

Sine and square wave pitch shift (up and down) - yellow is rightIn (no shift)
Sine 
- E4 329.63 Hz
-- 3 semitones up   pitch factor = 1.189
-- 2 semitones down pitch factor = 0.891

Square
- E4 329.63 Hz
-- 3 semitones up   pitch factor = 1.189
-- 2 semitones down pitch factor = 0.891


Speech original and shifted - blue is rightIn (no shift)
spoke 'hello'
- shift up by 12 semitones 
- shift down by 4 semitones

Echo: (blue is rightIn)
- sampleDelay = 1400, pitch factor = 1, play B4 (freq 493.88 Hz)
- img1 = both are playing 
- img2 = rightIn almost finished, echo remaining
- img3 = rightIn finished, echo remaining
- img4 = zoomed out to see overall envelope

Loop:
- img1 = signal to be repeated
- img2 = result of repeated signals

Pitch echo: (sine wave of freq 440 Hz played)
- img1 = highest pitch shift echo 
- img2 = high pitch shift echo
- img3 = mid pitch shift echo 
- img4 = low pitch shift echo


Matlab plots for sampler mode: (spoke 'hello')
- img1 = C4 (unchaged sample):
- img2 = C5 (octave up)
- img3 = C3 (octave down)


Playing last buffer: this is to be included in ping pong buffer implementation section
